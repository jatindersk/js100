// What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

// Exception handling is a process to deal with errors in a manageable way.
// It makes use of try/catch statement to catch the exception that the code in 
// try block raises. It then lets the programmer deal with the error in a graceful
// way and may also pevent a nasty bug or catastrophic failure.
