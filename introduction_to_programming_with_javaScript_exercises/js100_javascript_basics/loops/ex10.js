// Both statements execute the given block as long as the condition evaluates to true. 
// The difference is that the condition in a while statement is checked before executing 
// the block, while the condition in a do...while statement is checked after the block has been executed. 
// So the block in a do...while statement will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is not satisfied.

// Therefore the second code snippet logs 'Woooot!' once, while the first code snippet does not log anything.
